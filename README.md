(The Stock class) Following the example of the Circle class in §8.2, design a

class named Stock that contains:

■ A string data field named symbol for the stock’s symbol.

■ A string data field named name for the stock’s name.

■ A double data field named previousClosingPrice that stores the stock

price for the previous day.

■ A double data field named currentPrice that stores the stock price for the

current time.

■ A constructor that creates a stock with specified symbol and name.

■ A method named getChangePercent() that returns the percentage changed

from previousClosingPrice to currentPrice.

Draw the UML diagram for the class. Implement the class. Write a test program

that creates a Stock object with the stock symbol JAVA, the name Sun Microsystems

Inc, and the previous closing price of 4.5. Set a new current price to 4.35

and display the price-change percentage.
