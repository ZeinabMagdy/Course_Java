labels. A label may display an image icon for X, an image icon for O, or nothing,

as shown in Figure 12.15(c). What to display is randomly decided. Use the

Math.random() method to generate an integer 0, 1, or 2, which corresponds to

displaying a cross image icon, a not image icon, or nothing. The cross and not

images are in the files x.gif and o.gif, which are under the image directory

in www.cs.armstrong.edu/liang/intro8e/book.zip).
